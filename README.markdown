# Deck: An example app

## What is it

Deck is a very primitive slideshow app used to demonstrate basic
features of Backbone.js. It includes the following functionality:

- Create a new deck
- Add a slide to the deck
- View a slide deck in presentation mode

## Run the tests

- Ruby: Uses Rspec, so just do `rspec spec`
- JavaScript: Uses Jasmine, start the server up and navigate to
`localhost:4567/test-js/SpecRunner.html`

*Tested with: Ruby 1.9.3p0*
